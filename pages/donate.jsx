This fund is being administered by 30Amp Circuit – an award winning Philly based 501(c)3. In this uncertain time, the founders pivoted and put this year’s plans on hold to dedicate their time to this one singular purpose while the world waits for its return to normalcy.

100% of the donations raised by Love From Philly enters our 30Amp Philly fund which fuels our micro-grant program for immediate cost of living relief from the effects of COVID-19 . Philadelphia artists, venue workers, and freelancers are eligible to receive a $330 grant pending the approval of their application.

The process of applying for a grant is simple. Fill out the form located below and submit! 30Amp is working around the clock to quickly review and verify applications. Grants will be rewarded on a first come first serve basis with a goal that no qualified applicant goes without receiving this aid.
